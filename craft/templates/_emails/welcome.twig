Dear {{user.fullName}},

First, thank you for your support and membership to the leading water quality organization in Texas!

You may have noticed that WEAT’s logo and website have changed. We’re delighted at our evolution and hope you’re pleased to use our streamlined database and website.

The new website and database will allow for a much improved member experience with easy online membership and renewal, conference registration, and public information at your fingertips. Peruse the [upcoming events](https://www.weat.org/events) and check out our [featured committee page](https://www.weat.org/learn) with public information and timely posts. While many excellent pages are now live, we have quite a few others that will come online soon and are geared specifically to various member demographics, public education, and our water quality advocacy work. So, check back in the next few weeks.

And as always, please let us know how we can improve our programs and communication!

Best regards,

Your WEAT Team
